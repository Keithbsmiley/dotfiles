# How to use

To use this vim configuration you can do one of two things:

1. (Recommended) Find a place where you can store this folder and symlink the files and folders to your home directory.

    EX: `ln -s ~/Documents/vim/vimrc ~/.vimrc`

2. Move the files to `~/` and rename them appropriately.
